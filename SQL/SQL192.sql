-- Table: Transactions.   #hard keep learning
-- user_id    INT
-- txn_date   DATE
-- amount     DECIMAL
-- Task: For each user_id, find their longest streak of consecutive days 
-- with at least one transaction, and return:
-- user_id | streak_start | streak_end | streak_length
-- 	If multiple streaks tie for longest, return the earliest one (smallest streak_start).
-- 	â€¢	Order output by user_id.
