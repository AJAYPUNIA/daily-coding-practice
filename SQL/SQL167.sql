-- Write a SQL query to find the top 3 products with

SELECT p.product_id , p.product_name , SUM(p.price * o.quantity) AS total_revenue
FROM Products p
INNER JOIN Orders o ON p.product_id = o.product_id
WHERE YEAR(o.order_date) = 2025
GROUP BY p.product_id ,p.product_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 3;
